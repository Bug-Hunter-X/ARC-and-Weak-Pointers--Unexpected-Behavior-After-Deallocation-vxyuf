To fix this issue, you should explicitly check if the weak pointer is nil before accessing it:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id delegate;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    // ... some code ...
    if (self.delegate) {
        [self.delegate someDelegateMethod];
    }
    // ... more code ...
}
@end
```

This simple addition of a nil check prevents any attempt to access the object after it has been deallocated, resolving the unexpected behavior.
