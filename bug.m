In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and `__weak` pointers.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id delegate;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    // ... some code ...
    if (self.delegate) {
        [self.delegate someDelegateMethod];
    }
    // ... more code ...
}
@end
```

If `someDelegateMethod` internally releases or deallocates `self`,  and `self` is the only strong reference to the `MyClass` object, this can lead to a crash.  Even though `delegate` is weak, accessing `self.delegate` after `self` has been deallocated is an error. The weak pointer will be nil, but dereferencing it still causes issues (a crash). This issue doesn't always manifest immediately making it more challenging to debug.
